This project involves creating a comprehensive HR dashboard using a simulated dataset that mirrors real-world employee information typically found in HR systems. The dataset includes various employee attributes such as demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data, offering a rich source for analysis and visualization.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

The primary goal of this project is to provide HR managers with a user-friendly and insightful dashboard that allows for both high-level and detailed analysis of human resources data. The dashboard is designed in Tableau and is divided into two main views: Summary View and Employee Records View.

<h3>Summary View</h3>
The Summary View is categorized into three sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis.

<h3>Overview View</h3>
Overview: Provides a snapshot of key HR metrics, including the total number of hired, active, and terminated employees. It also visualizes hiring and termination trends over the years, department-wise employee distribution, and comparisons between headquarters and branch locations (with New York as the HQ).
Demographics: Offers insights into the workforce composition, such as gender ratio, age group distribution, education levels, and correlations between educational background and performance ratings.
Income Analysis: Focuses on salary metrics, comparing salaries across different education levels, analyzing gender-based salary discrepancies, and exploring the relationship between age and salary within departments.
Employee Records View
This view provides a detailed list of all employees, including critical information such as name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary. Users can filter the list based on any of the available columns, making it easier to perform in-depth analyses.

<h2>Features</h2>

Comprehensive Data Analysis: The dashboard offers both summary insights and detailed records, allowing HR managers to make informed decisions.
Interactive Visualization: The use of Tableau enables interactive visualizations, making it easier to explore different aspects of the HR data.
User Story-Driven Design: The project is designed around a user story focused on the needs of an HR manager, ensuring the dashboard is practical and relevant.
